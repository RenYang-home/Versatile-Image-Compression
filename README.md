By Hiaichuan Ma, Dong Liu

This repo provides the official implementation of the paper "iWave++".

## **BibTeX**

TO DO

## **Update Notes**

2020.9.4  Upload code and models of **Lossy multi-model iWave++**.

2020.8.26 Init this repo.

## **How To Test**
0. Dependencies. We test with MIT deepo 

1. Clone this github repo.

2. Place Test images. (The code now only supports images whose border length is a multiple of 16. However, it is very simple to support arbitrary boundary lengths by padding.)

3. Download models. See **Model** folder.

4. python main_testRGB.py. (The path in main_testRGB.py needs to be modified. Please refer to the code.)
